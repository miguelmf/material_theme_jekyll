## Hints

If you want to use my jekyll theme, follow the instructions and host it yourself. Easily setup as a Github page.  

To add pages (for example a portfolio, an extra about page, and so on), you need to link them to the `index.html` manually. Required to configure in this dimensions is a bit of html and jekyll know-how. Reading the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) could help. All other things are easy to edit and configure, even without much jekyll experience.  

#### Theme features  
- Projects showcase  
- RSS and ATOM feed  
- Blogpost pagination  
- SEO meta tags, *schema.org* structured data  
- [twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started) cards  
- made with MaterializeCSS
- Disqus comments  

## Setup

### 1. Get the sources

#### 1.1 Clone

Clone the repository from github:  
[https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme.git](https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme.git)   

#### 1.2 or download  
[https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme/archive/gh-pages.zip](https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme/archive/gh-pages.zip)  

### 2. Configure  
- Replace all the configuration in `_config.yml` and `_data/projects.yml` by your own data. Change the name, email address, configure your your language settings.  
And most important: change the site's URL! Optionally add your google analytics ID.

- Put your address and legal info into `imprint.html`.  

- Change the icon `images/favicon.png`.  

- Replace the domain name in the `robots.txt`

- Don't forget the `README.md`.  

### 3. Start writing posts  
Replace the existing example post and then add your own!  
Have a look at the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
about how to write blog posts.  
To add tags to your posts, look into the example, you'll see that there is
a line starting with `tags:`. Add your keywords there. 

### 4. You're done

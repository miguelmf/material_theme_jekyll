<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>I’ve been looking for an easy to use theme for a personal site (which I will most likely not actively use) and I came across a jekyll theme called <em>material</em>. Jekyll is a pretty nice and easy to use static site generator. Another alternative to jekyll is <em>hugo</em>, which is also great. You can’t go wrong with either one.</p>

<p>So, the material theme is made by lukas-h and is hosted on github (https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme). It is MIT licensed.</p>

<p>I’ve made some changes to it in order to use it as my own personal site. Here’s what I changed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Disabled google-analytics (I’m an pretty averse to tracking and I effectively use browser add-ons in order to safely browse the internet. It would be pretty hypocrite of me to have it on my own website);</li>
  <li>Changed to a dark/night mode (I usually prefer dark background in pretty much everything I do on the computer. Helps with vision and hides the annoying dead pixels);</li>
  <li>Increased paragraph’s width (I find the default width to be too narrow);</li>
  <li>Added support for mathjax (I come from a background where math is often used. Having support for latex is a must);</li>
  <li>Added an <strong>about</strong> page (The content of this page is, however, directly written in the .html file. I would like to have an about.md on the root directory instead, but I couldn’t make it work. If you know how, please let me know);</li>
  <li>Several changes to the Posts menu (removed the small paragraph below each post, broght the titles closer together, added “»»” for eye guidance, etc);</li>
  <li>Changed coloring of the buttons, when active and when inactive;</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s it. Please check out the original theme in https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme. lukas-h did great here and he also has other nice themes. Check him out.</p>
